The purpose of the project is to  to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysi

The project contains the R code, tidy data and codebook.

R code describes the following steps:

1. Downloading the raw data into R
2.Merge of the datasets train and test 
3.Extract measures of mean and standard deviation
4.Name the activities in the data set using desciptive activities
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.opriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

Tidy data is the output after running the R code

Codebook contains the vearibles and their desciptions
